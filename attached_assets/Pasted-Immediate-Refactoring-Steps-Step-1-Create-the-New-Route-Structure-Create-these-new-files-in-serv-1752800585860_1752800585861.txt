Immediate Refactoring Steps:
Step 1: Create the New Route Structure
Create these new files in server/routes/:

server/routes/auth.ts - Authentication & permissions server/routes/users.ts - User management
server/routes/projects.ts - Projects & tasks server/routes/messages.ts - Messaging system server/routes/collections.ts - Sandwich collections server/routes/drivers.ts - Driver management server/routes/hosts.ts - Host management server/routes/analytics.ts - Statistics & reporting

Step 2: Extract Common Middleware
Create server/middleware/auth.ts:

import { storage } from "../storage-wrapper";

export const requirePermission = (permission: string) => {
  return async (req: any, res: any, next: any) => {
    try {
      let user = req.user || req.session?.user;
      if (!user) {
        return res.status(401).json({ message: "Authentication required" });
      }
      
      // Check permissions logic here
      const hasPermission = checkUserPermissions(user, permission);
      if (!hasPermission) {
        return res.status(403).json({ message: "Insufficient permissions" });
      }
      
      next();
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).json({ message: "Internal server error" });
    }
  };
};

export const isAuthenticated = (req: any, res: any, next: any) => {
  const user = req.user || req.session?.user;
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: "Authentication required" });
  }
  next();
};
Step 3: Extract Route Categories
Projects Routes (extract lines 509-800 from current routes.ts):

import { Router } from "express";
import { storage } from "../storage-wrapper";
import { requirePermission } from "../middleware/auth";

const router = Router();

router.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  // Move GET /api/projects logic here
});

router.post("/", requirePermission("edit_data"), async (req, res) => {
  // Move POST /api/projects logic here
});

// Continue with all project-related routes...

export default router;
Step 4: Create Route Aggregator
Create server/routes/index.ts:

import { Express } from "express";
import authRoutes from "./auth";
import usersRoutes from "./users";
import projectsRoutes from "./projects";
// ... other imports

export function registerRoutes(app: Express) {
  app.use("/api/auth", authRoutes);
  app.use("/api/users", usersRoutes);
  app.use("/api/projects", projectsRoutes);
  // ... other route registrations
}
Step 5: Update Main Routes File
Gradually replace the monolithic routes.ts with:

import { registerRoutes } from "./routes/index";

export async function setupRoutes(app: Express): Promise<Server> {
  // Register all modular routes
  registerRoutes(app);
  
  // Keep existing socket and WebSocket setup
  // Remove the massive route definitions
  
  return httpServer;
}
Priority Implementation Order:
Week 1: Extract auth, users, and projects routes (highest impact)
Week 2: Extract messages, collections, and drivers routes
Week 3: Extract remaining routes and clean up debug code
Week 4: Performance optimization and testing
Expected Benefits:
Maintainability: From 2/10 to 8/10
Developer Experience: From 2/10 to 9/10
Performance: From 3/10 to 7/10
File Navigation: From impossible to instant
This refactoring will transform your codebase from an unmaintainable mess into a professional, scalable architecture. The biggest wins will come from:

Breaking the 7,114-line monster into 12 focused modules
Removing debug pollution (100+ console.log statements)
Eliminating code duplication
Standardizing error handling
